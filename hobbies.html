                    <p>I am currently 20 years old. In my spare time, you can either find me programming side projects or learning many other things! I try to maintain a fit and healthy lifestyle despite my busy schedule through running around my neighbourhood or weight training. As a Computer Science student, I also do like to work my brain through puzzle games and love speedcubing. I am pretty decent at rhythm games, but I do not really play much in arcades as I prefer playing at home on PC/mobile/consoles.</p>
                    <p>I do have some interesting hobbies I used to partake in! I even used to <em>stack cups</em> professionally and even won tournaments for this niche sport! While I have mostly quit, I do try to consistently give back to this community because it was the hobby that defined my secondary school years.</p>
                    <p>I am always willing to learn new things, there is no limit to what you can learn! I do want to explore new hobbies, like musical instruments or cooking/baking.</p>

                            I love solving Rubik's cubes and other similar twisty puzzles, but ironically has never joined any WCA competition. Maybe as I get faster I will join them but I generally solve casually whenever I feel like it.

                            I do try to maintain a weekly gym and running routine, and I will try to exercise for 5 days a week depending on my weekly schedule. I do play racket sports like badminton and table tennis recreationally, but I am generally not as skilled in these sports. I am always open to learning new sports, especially if they are individual/pair sports.

                            <strong>Programming</strong>
                            <span class="event-date">2011 &ndash; Present</span>
                            <br>
                            I have been programming since primary school! From learning from a YouTube video on how to make a calculator in HTML/JavaScript till today, I have never given up my love for programming and I have always known that this would be my future ambition.
                            </p>
                            <p>In 2012, I created a few games using Game Maker and other programs using Visual Basic .NET, since it was included in Visual Studio and I found out that this could be used to write Windows programs.</p>
                            <p>From 2013 to 2017, I did not really focus on programming as much due to other hobbies and school taking my time.</p>
                            <p>From 2018 onwards, my love for programming was mostly rekindled due to Computing being offered as a subject in my Junior College. This subject gave me a lot of exposure to other aspects of Computing and opportunities to join many Computing competitions and events. It was really gratifying to have formal programming education since I have been self-learnt ever since I started programming as a hobby in 2012.</p>
                            <p>Nowadays, I do want to explore other aspects of programming, as can be seen scattered throughout this website. From learning new APIs and libraries, to making programs for social good, I do see a bright future ahead of me and I am excited for what is to come!</p>

                            <br>
                            I do volunteer regularly and sign up for events regularly! While I have only started doing so frequently in 2022, I have joined a lot of events since my Junior College days in 2018. I am aiming to expand my horizons and do a lot more for the community, including the planning and execution of volunteer events. A full list of my community service and volunteer achievements can be found <a href="./volunteering.html">here</a>.

                            <strong>Sport Stacking (Cup stacking)</strong>
                            <span class="event-date">Mar 2013 &ndash; 2017</span>
                            <br>
                            This is an interesting hobby of mine that has helped me last through my secondary school years. Sport stacking is a sport (debatably) where participants stack a set of 12 plastic cups in various pre-defined sequences as quickly as possible. I used to publish a lot of videos about it onto <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoEMKiEtEN1Ad68gZE881iw">YouTube</a> to share with other like-minded people. A fun fact is that this sport indirectly got me into speedcubing since both hobbies use the same timing equipment, as well as video editing (which is currently part of my skillset).
