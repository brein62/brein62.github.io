                            Reach Out is an organisation aiming to help the elderly and needy in rental flats all around Singapore by providing pre-loved goods, food and other necessities donated by others. Events are held on average twice a month on Sundays. I have been volunteering with this organisation nearly consistently and joined most events since Apr 2022. It also has programmes to help migrant worker communities in Singapore. Here is the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/2385004058279341">link to Reach Out's official Facebook group page</a>.

During this event, the children played several game stations before being presented with their gifts. I was a volunteer for the first event on 9 Jun, engaging a group of 3 children there.
