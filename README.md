# brein62.github.io

Hi! I'm Brendan Koh, also known as `brein62`, a Year 3 undergraduate studying Computer Science. I made this website to allow myself to gain more firsthand experience in web development while also allowing me to show what I've done to the world.

Check out my portfolio here: https://brein62.github.io

## About this project

This portfolio website is made using the [React](https://react.dev/) framework with a few additional supporting libraries: [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main), [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/), with icons from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/). I initially developed this website as a draft using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in Jun 2022, but started re-developing the website from the ground up in React in May and Jun 2024 in order to make updates more timely and easier to develop.

I hope you enjoy reading through my portfolio!
