          I am a Year 4 student currently pursuing a Bachelor of Computing (Computer Science) at the School of
          Computing, National University of Singapore. I have had years of experience programming as a hobby, and I
          pursued Computing as a subject during my Junior College days. In my free time, I not only code, but also solve
          Rubik's cubes, casually run, gym, as well as play puzzle or rhythm games. I also enjoy community service and
          volunteering and am always willing to help my peers and those in need. I am always welcome to learn new

              <em>Student Internship Programme (SIP)</em> in NUS, with primary focus on backend development using Java

              reusable asynchronous AI infrastructure for enterprise applications. Over the 11 weeks, I gained

              dead-letter queues (DLQs), with focus on traceability and observability of messages through Prometheus and
