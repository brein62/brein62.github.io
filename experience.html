                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>I am a freshman currently pursuing a Bachelor of Computing (Computer Science) at the <a href="https://comp.nus.edu.sg">School of Computing</a>, National University of Singapore. I have had years of experience programming as a hobby, and I pursued Computing as a subject during my Junior College days. In my free time, I not only code, but also solve Rubik's cubes, casually run, gym, as well as play puzzle or rhythm games. I also enjoy community service and <a href="./volunteering.html">volunteering</a> and am always willing to help my peers and those in need. I am always welcome to learn new hobbies or help others with my area of expertise!

                            In between my National Service and my current education in NUS, I worked at NTU, helping compile their faculty's research papers and achievements. I also helped out in small events held by SCSE, such as workshops with external organisations like Sea AI Lab. Although I mainly worked as an administrative assistant, I gained a lot of knowledge into how research works in universities, especially in the Computer Science field.
