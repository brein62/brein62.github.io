                            <h2>Introduction</h2>
                            <p>I am currently an incoming Year 1 student taking <strong>Computer Science</strong> at the <a href="https://comp.nus.edu.sg/">School of Computing, National University of Singapore (NUS)</a>. Prior to this, I was a Junior College student at , where I took H2 Computing as an academic subject. Taking H2 Computing opened a lot of opportunities for me as a student where I got the chance to represent my school in various competitions and events.</p>
                            <p>My goal is to use my love for Computing as a subject to help the wider community by participating and helping out in volunteer events and conferences, while participating in competitions to hone my current skills and gain more experience.</p>
